Data1:
After multiple insertion, the load factor of hash table with quadratic probing and double hashing is increasing (<1).

Data2:
the load factor of these two hash function are the same.

Data3:
After insertion of 53, the load factor of hash table with quadratic probing is 0.811321, 
but the load factor of hash table with double hashing is 0.830189.
Thus, the load factor with quadratic probing after insertion is greater than double hashing, 
but the load factor after deletion usually are the same.

Data4:
With insertion multiple elements to the hash table, the load factor with both hash function are increased with the same rate.

Data5:
Double hashing may avoid collision but if the hash is good and load factor is small then there isn't really any performance increased.

In summary, if the load factor is small, the chance of collision is lower.
